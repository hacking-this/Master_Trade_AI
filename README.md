## 🚀 Overview

**Master Trade AI** is a full-stack **AI-driven trading platform** that automates the lifecycle of data ingestion, analysis, model training, and visualization.
It integrates **Data Engineering**, **MLOps pipelines**, and an **interactive Streamlit frontend** — enabling automated financial insights, signal generation, and live trading analytics.

The system uses:

* **Apache Airflow** for orchestrating ML workflows
* **LangChain** for LLM-based decision support
* **Streamlit** for user-facing dashboards
* **Docker** for deployment consistency

---

## 🧩 Key Features

✅ **Automated Data Pipeline**

* Airflow DAGs for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) of financial data
* Scheduled retraining and backtesting workflows

✅ **AI-Powered Insights**

* Uses transformer-based or custom ML models for signal prediction
* Integration with LangChain for intelligent trading commentary

✅ **Streamlit Dashboard**

* Real-time visualization of market data and model outputs
* Interactive panels for custom strategies and backtests

✅ **End-to-End MLOps**

* Containerized using Docker
* CI/CD setup through GitHub Actions
* Cloud-ready (Streamlit Cloud, Airflow Docker Compose, etc.)

Would you like me to **add badges for Airflow, LangChain, and Docker Hub** (if you plan to publish images) — and a **custom banner image** for the top of the README? I can generate both for you.
